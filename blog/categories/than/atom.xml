    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Music popularized the idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27_Club">27 Club</a> but where are the other artists who also belong?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Using the biographical data on artists provided by the <a href="https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection">MoMA</a> I&rsquo;ve extracted a non-exhaustive list of birth and death dates where available.</p>

<ul>
<li>Il'ia Chashnik died from complications during surgery.</li>
<li>Robert Howlett died from arsenic and mercury poisoning as part of his photographic process. So some might say he died in a similar way to Janet and Jimi, from chemicals necessary for his art.</li>
<li>Henri Evenepoel died of Typhus.</li>
<li>Robert Adamson died from illness.</li>
<li>Roberto Ossaye died from causes I couldn&rsquo;t easily determine.</li>
<li>August Macke died during the First World War.</li>
</ul>


<p>From the dataset I also found Josef Raynefeld(Jozef Rajnfeld in Polish), but I think MoMA&rsquo;s date of birth for him is incorrect. Polish Wikipedia indicates he <a href="https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B3zef_Rajnfeld">lived to be 32</a>.</p>

<p>This&rsquo;ll be part of an ongoing series as I integrate other data sets in to my analysis.</p>

<p>Tune in next time when I break down some &ldquo;Untitled&rdquo; nonsense.</p>
